- Feature Name: Loggy

# Summary

[summary]: #summary

Loggy is a troubleshooting log viewer, as well as the surrounding infrastructure, that lets both support agents and users diagnose issues with their Dalamud install / plugins.

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

We're doing this because it's hard to diagnose issues with our traditional tools, especially at scale. We want something that Franzbot can link to, for both users and support agents, to get immediate answers to "why is this broken" for the most common use-cases.

# Guide-level explanation

[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Loggy is a log viewer for `.tspack` (TroubleShooting Pack) files uploaded by users. These files are generated by Dalamud when an error occurs.

Loggy will parse through the output of the pack, and inform the viewer of detected issues in a straightforward and easy-to-understand manner.

TODO: examples of common errors

<!-- Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the ecosystem and you were teaching it to another ecosystem participant. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how developers should _think_ about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use the ecosystem. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing developers and new developers.

For implementation-oriented DIPs (e.g. for Dalamud internals), this section should focus on how Dalamud contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy DIPs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms. -->

# Reference-level explanation

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This DIP proposes four changes to the ecosystem:
- Loggy (NotNite)
    - a React app running on a static filehost
    - fetches a `.tspack` that it's been linked to, locally, so forced to respect CORS
    - scans through the `.tspack` looking for common errors, displays a nice identification
    - provides a nice log viewer in addition to, or in lieu of, a nice identification
- Discord CDN proxy (goatcorp)
    - a proxy that takes a Discord CDN attachment URL, scoped to a few specific channels, and makes it available to Loggy with correct CORS
    - goat wants to host on kamori because serverless costs will add up
- Dalamud tspack generation (goatcorp)
    - generates highly-compressed tspacks containing all relevant logs
    - try/catch littered all around places where things can be reasonably expected to throw
        - it would be awesome if we wrapped hooks in try/catch but dunno how much we want to fork
    - issues that dalamud can identify will lead to specific, custom exceptions
        - "service not found" etc
        - any information that loggy can use to diagnose should be supplied
    - where possible, information should be structured and not require string parsing
        - json structures
        - nested exceptions should be represented as nested structures
        - callstack should be an array
- Franzbot integration (Franz)
    - Franzbot should detect the upload of a tspack and should generate a Loggy link pointing to the CDN proxy of the upload
        - goatcorp.github.io/loggy/?url=...

<!-- This is the technical portion of the DIP. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work. -->

# Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

we should not do this if we want to keep rifling through people's logs and/or using regex to do so

<!-- Why should we _not_ do this? -->

# Rationale and alternatives

[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- the big decision is whether or not to host tspacks ourselves
    - we can, but that's more trouble than it's worth with the state of our current infrastructure setup
    - to do that, we would want to resolve https://github.com/goatcorp/DIPs/issues/46
    - a proxy is a decent solution until then

<!-- - Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this? -->

# Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

<!-- Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For Dalamud, infrastructure, and tools proposals: Does this feature exist in other plugin ecosystems and what experience have their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other ecosystems and provide readers of your DIP with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

Note that while precedent set by other ecosystems is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an DIP.
Please also take into consideration that Dalamud sometimes intentionally diverges from common modding features. -->

# Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

<!-- - What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the DIP process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this DIP that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this DIP? -->

# Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

<!-- Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project in your proposal.
Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project
and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
DIP you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future DIP; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent DIPs.
The section merely provides additional information. -->
